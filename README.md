# ASR582X

ASR582X is a low-power, high-performance, highly integrated combo SoC supporting 1x1 IEEE 802.11 b/g/n and BLE 5.1. The chip integrates RF transceiver, 802.11/BLE PHY + MAC, Arm China STAR-MC1 Processor, multiple peripheral interfaces, AOA/AOD, Real Time Counter (RTC) and a complete power management module. ASR582X provides a convenient and fast BLE networking, currently only in 6 seconds (optimization is ongoing). ASR5822S also supports a group of UART ports with ESD capacity being equal to over 6KV HBM contact discharge, which helps to save electrostatic protection devices on the module's communication interface. In addition, with a complete security system structure, the chip supports a suite of multi-layered security solutions. ASR582X can be used either as a master chip or as a functional chip for WLAN connectivity matching with external master control.
